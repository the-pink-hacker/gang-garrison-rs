# Gang Garrison 2 Rust Rewrite

This project started off because my friend is rewriting the server of GG2 in [python](https://github.com/Minecraftboss318/gg2-python-dedicated-server).
I thought it would be cool to rewrite the client as well.
This project is currently only focused on the client but with the possiblity of one day writing a server as well.

## What's Implemented

- [x] Server hello
- [x] Player joining
- [x] Map loading
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Player controller

A more detailed description of the project's development can be found on my [blog](https://thepinkhacker.com/blog/post/gg2_rust).

This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge of [Minecraftboss318](https://github.com/Minecraftboss318).
