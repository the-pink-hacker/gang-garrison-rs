# Gang Garrison 2 Rust Rewrite

GG2 built off of Rust + WGPU + Tokio

This project started off because my friend is rewriting the server of GG2 in [python](https://github.com/Minecraftboss318/gg2-python-dedicated-server).
I thought it would be cool to rewrite the client as well.
This project is currently only focused on the client but with the possiblity of one day writing a server as well.

A more detailed description of the project's development can be found on my [blog](https://thepinkhacker.com/blog/post/gg2_rust). It should be noted this blog post is now fairly old and was before I chose the path of a custom game engine.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge of [Minecraftboss318](https://github.com/Minecraftboss318).
